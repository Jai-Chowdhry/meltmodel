##MeltMod: A Glacier Mass Balance Model##

MeltMod is a fully distributed mass-balance model for mountain glaciers, developed by Regine Hock and  Carleen Tijm-Reijmer.

Short-term mass balance variations (ablation and accumulation) are calculated  by a selection of various energy-balance and temperature-index methods.

Further information about MeltMod is available [here](http://www2.gi.alaska.edu/~regine/meltmodel.html).
