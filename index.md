Overview
--------

MeltMod is a fully-distributed, mass-balance model for mountain
glaciers, developed by Regine Hock and Carleen Tijm-Reijmer. Short-term
mass balance variations (ablation and accumulation) are calculated by a
selection of various energy-balance and temperature-index methods.

Glacier discharge is calculated from modeled melt and observed
precipitation. Runoff is then modeled via a collection of linear
reservoirs, after (Baker, 1982).

Furthermore, subsurface tempurature, water content and percolation can
be computed via a layered snowmodel, undergoing forcing by the surface
energy balance.
