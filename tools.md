* __[Impervious](https://github.com/fmuzf/matlab_hk_impervious)__:
A Matlab tool for running the models over ranges
of parameter values. This is particularly useful for
automated parameter calibration, running the model in batches,
or simply running the model from Matlab.
* __[Glazer](https://github.com/fmuzf/matlab_hk_glazer)__:
A tool for importing and exporting DEBaM and DETIM
 ```input.txt``` files. Implementations exist for
[Matlab](https://github.com/fmuzf/matlab_hk_glazer)
and [Python](https://github.com/fmuzf/python_hk_glazer).
Glazer can read input.txt files into native data-structures,
as well as output them into valid configuration files.
