    <h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Welcome to the homepage of two open source glacier surface mass-balance and discharge
models (Version 2.0.2):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>D</strong>istributed <strong>E</strong>nergy <strong>Ba</strong>lance <strong>M</strong>odel (DEBAM)</li>
<li><strong>D</strong>istributed <strong>E</strong>nhanced <strong>T</strong>emperature <strong>I</strong>ndex <strong>M</strong>odel (DETIM)</li>
</ul>

<p>The models compute <strong>glacier surface mass balance</strong> (ablation and accumulation) and
discharge, with hourly to daily resolution.
The mass balance model is fully distributed, i.e. calculations are performed for each grid cell of a
digital elevation model. Discharge is calculated by three
linear reservoirs corresponding to the different storage properties of firn,
snow and glacier ice. <strong>Discharge</strong> simulations are optional, i.e. the mass balance
model can be run independently of the discharge model. Glacier <strong>retreat</strong> may also
be modeled using a simple volume-area scaling.
In addition, DEBaM can compute subsurface temperatures, water content and percolation
via a 1-D <strong>multi-layer snow model</strong> that is forced by the surface energy balance.</p>

<p><strong>Minimum data requirements</strong> are a digital elevation model and hourly or daily air
temperature and precipitation data (DETIM) and temperature, precipitation, wind speed, relative humidity
and shortwave incoming radiation (DEBAM).</p>

<p>The models were initially developed by Regine Hock in the mid 1990s, and have
since been continuously expanded. In 2006, Carleen Tijm-Reijmer contributed
the subsurface snow model used by DEBAM. The models are portable to different platforms (Mac, Linux, Windows ...).
The models were made open source in August 2012
with help of Lyman Gillispie.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>DEBAM</strong> computes surface melt by an energy balance approach</li>
<li><strong>DETIM</strong> computes surface melt by various temperature index approaches.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Download</h2>

<p>The models are hosted from our <a href="http://github.com/regine/meltmodel">github repository</a>.
You can download the source as zip or tar files via:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://github.com/regine/meltmodel/zipball/master">meltmodel-master.zip</a></li>
<li> <a href="http://github.com/regine/meltmodel/tarball/master">meltmodel-master.tar.gz</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Alternately, you can also clone the project with <a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a> by
running:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ git clone https://github.com/regine/meltmodel.git
</code></pre></div>
<p>from a terminal (i.e. open a terminal and copy the line above (git ....) into the command line).
If you plan to modify the model source code, or contribute to the
project, this is the preferred method. More information about git can be
found at <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git-scm</a> or at
<a href="http://help.github.com/articles/">Github</a>.</p>

<p>The download will always include both DETIM and DEBAM. Most files are needed for both models.
Note that the <strong><em>master version</em></strong> is always the most up-to-date model version.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Prerequisites:</p>

<ul>
<li>GNU Make</li>
<li>A working C compiler</li>
</ul>

<p>To build DEBAM and DETIM, do</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ cd meltmodel
$ make models
</code></pre></div>
<p>The model executables (detim and debam) will now be located in <code>meltmodel/bin</code></p>

<p>A <strong>complete installation guide</strong> is available <a href="install-web.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Documentation/Manual</h2>

<p>The most recent revision of the manual is available <a href="http://gi.alaska.edu/%7Eregine/meltmodel.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Additional Model Tools</h2>

<p>Additional tools have been developed to help with certain tasks related to the model, for example,
making model calibration more efficient; a partial list of these may be found at the <a href="tools.html">External Tools page</a>.</p>

<h2>Literature And Previous Applications</h2>

<p>The models are described in detail in the following papers:</p>

<h2>Versioning</h2>

<p>As of version 1.0.0 (September 2013), we&#39;ve begun using <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a>
to dictate model version numbers. Roughly speaking, version numbers consist of
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, which are incremented when</p>

<ol>
<li>MAJOR: when backwards incompatible changes are made</li>
<li>MINOR: when backwards-compatible functionality is added</li>
<li>PATCH: when backwards-compatible bug fixes are made.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, your parameter file (input.txt) of model version
<code>1.0.3</code> will not work with version <code>3.6.4</code> but will work
with <code>1.2.0</code> and <code>1.0.4</code>.</p>

<p>The various versions of the model are marked in git with <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tagging">tags</a>
and can be <a href="https://github.com/regine/meltmodel/releases">reviewed on Github</a>.</p>

<h2>Additional Information</h2>

<p>For further information contact <a href="http://gi.alaska.edu/%7Eregine/">Regine Hock</a>,
(University of Alaska, Fairbanks) or <a href="http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/%7Ereijm101/">Carleen Tijm-Reijmer</a>
(University Utrecht). Note that the model may
contain errors and the model manual may not be complete or outdated. User
support and further code improvements are available in direct collaboration
with us.</p>

<p>If you find errors or have suggestions how the manual (or model) can be improved,
please feel free to let up know via the Github Issues page for the models or via email.</p>

<h2>Model updates and changes</h2>

<p>The model constantly evolves. All significant model changes and updates since 2012 are logged <a href="http://github.com/regine/meltmodel/tree/master/changes.md">here</a>.
If you are interested in contributing to the model directly, for example, by adding new features, check our <a href="contributing.html">contributing page</a>. We use <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>
and <a href="github.com">Github</a> to manage our code.</p>
