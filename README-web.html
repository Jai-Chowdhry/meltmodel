    <h2>The Basics</h2>

<p>Beginning in January 2015, we&#39;ve migrated this page from markdown-based format
centered around Jekyll and Gihthub Pages to a more vanilla, html-based format.
We still host the page on Github, but now all editing happens in raw html
files, which no longer require any generation for previewing.</p>

<h2>Editing the Webpage</h2>

<h3>Download a Copy of the Webpage</h3>

<p>Github has a system known as Pages, to automatically generate webpages
for projects which are hosted there.  Pages uses a git branch
of the project called <code>gh-pages</code> to store the project webpage.
If you would like to make edits to the webpage, open your terminal,
and start with a fresh clone of the project:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ git clone https://github.com/regine/meltmodel.git
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now that we have a clean working copy, we need to navigate into it
and check out the <code>gh-pages</code> branch.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ cd meltmodel

$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>gh-pages</code> is what is known as a &quot;orphan branch&quot;,
and its contents are unrelated to the main line of
development for the model. By switching into the <code>gh-pages</code>
branch, git will replace the contents of the <code>meltmodel</code>
folder downloaded from Github (by default this will be the
current version of the models&#39; source code) with the source
for the webpage. If you need to get back to the model code
type <code>git branch</code> to see the list of branches tracked by
git, and then <code>git checkout &lt;branch name&gt;</code> to checkout
the code in branch <code>&lt;branch name&gt;</code>. This does not work if changes have been
made to files in the repository that have not been committed yet.
A workaround is to temporarily stash the changes by the command <code>git stash</code>.
Now you can switch branches. Once you switch back you can
retrieve the changes by <code>git stash pop</code>. <code>git stash list</code> gives you a
list of what is in the stash.
Alternatively (recommended), instead of switching between gh-pages and the
release branch, checkout out <code>gh-pages</code> and the release in different folders,
i.e. download 2 different copies.
More info about git can be found at the <a href="http://git-scm.com">git project</a>.</p>

<p>On the gh-pages branch you will find 6 html-files:
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>File name</th>
      <th>Content</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>contributing.html</td>
      <td>Web-page describing how to contribute to the model code</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>index.html</td>
      <td>Main model page</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>instal-web.html</td>
      <td>Instalation guide</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>README-web.html</td>
      <td>This page describing how to change the webpage</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>references.html</td>
      <td>Page with references using the model</td>
    </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>tools.html</td>
      <td>Page about MultiRun, Glazer</td>
    </tr>
    
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Making Edits to these files</h3>

<p>This webpage is written in HTML, and styled with a CSS file.
These files may be modified in any text editior suitable for editing source code.</p>

<h3>Previewing the Site</h3>

<p>Once we have made edits, it&#39;s wise choice is to preview them in a web-browser
to verify that they look correct. Simply open the .html file you&#39;ve been editing
using your favorite browser.</p>

<h3>Uploading the Site to GitHub Pages</h3>

<p>Once we are finished editing the site, we need to
upload it to Github. This is done by making a new
commit to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch using git.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Commit these changes; we&#39;ll use the <code>-a</code> flag to add all changes made</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ git commit -a
</code></pre></div></li>
</ul>

<p>git will open an editor, and you should enter a brief
  message describing the changes you have made. If this does not work
  or if the message is sufficiently short, you can bypass the
  editor, and enter you message on the commandline using the <code>-m</code>
  command-line option</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">    $ git commit -a -m &quot;&lt;commit-message&gt;&quot;
</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li><p>Push these changes to the server:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ git push origin gh-pages
</code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>Check the project website and make sure the changes have posted. If not, check
Github&#39;s <a href="http://status.github.com">status page</a> to see if there&#39;s an outage.</p></li>
<li><p>The full documentation for Github Pages can be viewed <a href="http://help.github.com/pages/">here</a></p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Editing the .md-files on the model branch</h3>
<p>When downloading DETIM/DEBAM, 3 .md files will appear in the meltmodel
folder once you have switched to the gh-paes branch ($git checkout
gh-pages). These correspond to the following .html-files:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
     <th>Model Source</th>
     <th>gh-pages</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>README.md</td>
      <td>index.html</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>INSTALL.md</td>
      <td>install-web.html</td>
    </tr>
        <tr>
      <td>changes.md</td>
      <td><i>no corresponding html-file</i></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
This helps ensure that when someone downloads the code, they&#39;ve also
recieved instructions on how to get it up and running in case they
don't have access to the internet. NOTE, if the .html files are
updated and pushed to github, the .md-files remain
unchanged. Therefore it is necessary to update them as well to make
sure the corresponding .md and .html-files are the same and always updated.</p>

<h3>Editing changes.md</h3>
The webpage points at the copy of <b><i>changes.md</i></b> located in the main
source on github, and does not have an html version.
The 'changes'-webpage is modified by editing changes.md locally, and
pushing the edited version up with git, or by applying changes
directly at the github page.
